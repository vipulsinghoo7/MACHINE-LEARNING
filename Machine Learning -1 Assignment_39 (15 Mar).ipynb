    "1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. AI can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing speech and images, and making decisions. AI can be divided into two main categories:\n",
    "i) Narrow or Weak AI\n",
    "ii) General or Strong AI\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Example:** One example of AI is self-driving cars. These cars use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze their surroundings and make decisions based on that analysis. They can navigate traffic, avoid obstacles, and make decisions based on traffic laws and road conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Machine Learning (ML):** Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task by learning from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. Machine learning algorithms can be classified into three main categories:\n",

    "3. **Deep Learning (DL):** Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Deep learning algorithms use multiple layers of interconnected nodes to process and learn from data. Deep learning is capable of learning from unstructured data such as images, videos, and audio.\n",

    ">**Example:** An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep learning models can be trained to identify objects within images, such as cars or people. These models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze the features of an image and classify it into different categories based on those features. For example, a deep learning model could be trained to identify different breeds of dogs within a photo."

    "Unsupervised clustering algorithms like k-means or DBSCAN can be used to group similar instances together. Anomalies are identified as data points that do not belong to any of the well-defined clusters or are far away from the majority of data points. By setting a threshold or using outlier detection methods, anomalies can be identified based on their distance or density from the clusters.\n",

    "Association rule mining techniques, such as Apriori or FP-Growth, can be utilized. These algorithms discover frequent itemsets or patterns in the data. Anomalies can be detected by identifying infrequent or rare itemsets that deviate from the established patterns. The key advantage of unsupervised anomaly detection is its ability to identify anomalies without relying on labeled data. It can be particularly useful in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce or not available. However, it is important to note that unsupervised methods may generate false positives and require careful consideration of threshold settings or further validation steps."
